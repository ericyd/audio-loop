# loop-supreme

A project that I'm building in public!

I wanted to do some live looping on my keyboard but wasn't super satisfied with any of the options out there. I wanted something quick-and-dirty but made it (somewhat) easy to do a loop performance.

I've also been itching for a side project. Seemed like a great way to feed two birds with one scone!

## What features does / will this have?

## Where can I read more?

I'm planning to blog about the experience of building it.
