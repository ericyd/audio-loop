  <strong><em>Browser-based live looper for music performance and audio fun!</em></strong>

## Motivation

I wanted to do some live looping on my keyboard but wasn't super satisfied with any of the options out there. I wanted something quick-and-dirty but made it (somewhat) easy to do a loop performance.

I've also been itching for a side project. Seemed like a great way to feed two birds with one scone!

## What features does / will this have?

You can check out [The Roadmap](./roadmap.md)!

## Where can I read more?

I'm planning to blog about the experience of building it.

You can [check out my blog here!](https://ericyd.hashnode.dev/)

## Building / running locally

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ericyd/loop-supreme
cd loop-supreme
npm i
npm start
npm run build
```
